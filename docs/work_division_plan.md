# Work Division Plan – Data Mining Project

## Project Title: Retail Stock Market Behavior

**Course:** Data Mining  
**Academic Term:** November 2025 – December 2025  
**Team Members:**  
- **Tejmul Movin**  
- **A Jithendranath**  
- **M Sree Sai Nath**

---

## 1. Overview

This work division plan defines the **phase-wise responsibilities, leadership rotation, and deliverables** for the project *Retail Stock Market Behavior*.  
The project analyzes the **UCI Online Retail dataset** to uncover purchasing patterns, customer segmentation, and sales trends through data-mining methodologies.  

The primary objective of this plan is to ensure:
- Equal technical and documentation contributions across all members.  
- Clear accountability through leadership rotation.  
- Systematic workflow aligned with data-mining process stages (CRISP-DM methodology).

## 2. Leadership Rotation and Responsibilities

Leadership rotates across three phases to provide each team member with opportunities to manage planning, analysis, and modeling components.

| Phase   | Team Lead        | Key Responsibilities |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| **Phase 1** | **Tejmul Movin** | Planning, dataset understanding, preprocessing strategy, and documentation coordination |
| **Phase 2** | **A Jithendranath** | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), trend visualization, and insights synthesis |
| **Phase 3** | **M Sree Sai Nath** | Predictive modeling, evaluation, and report consolidation |

Each phase lead is responsible for ensuring timely deliverables, coordinating merges on GitHub, and maintaining documentation consistency.

## 3. Phase-Wise Work Allocation

### **Phase 1 – Planning, Documentation, and Data Understanding (Nov 1 – Nov 5)**

**Objective:**  
Establish project foundation by defining the problem, setting objectives, understanding the dataset, and planning preprocessing workflows.

| Member | Tasks | Deliverables |
| ------- | ------ | ------------ |
| **Tejmul Movin (Lead)** | Define research scope, dataset rationale, and preprocessing plan; set up GitHub structure | `dataset_description_and_rationale.md`, `data_preprocessing_plan.md`, `phase1_report_compiled.pdf` |
| **A Jithendranath** | Draft research objectives, problem definition, and hypothesis statements | `research_objectives.md`, `hypotheses_and_innovation.md` |
| **M Sree Sai Nath** | Document methodology framework and assist in literature synthesis | `methodology_plan.md`, `literature_review_summary.md`, `README.md` |

**Expected Outcome:**  
A complete documentation framework and repository setup that clearly defines the study direction, objectives, and methodology.

---

### **Phase 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization (Nov 6 – Nov 20)**

**Objective:**  
Explore, clean, and visualize the dataset to identify patterns, correlations, and initial insights that inform modeling decisions.

| Member | Tasks | Deliverables |
| ------- | ------ | ------------ |
| **A Jithendranath (Lead)** | Lead EDA, design visualization dashboards, and interpret customer and product trends | `EDA_Visualizations.ipynb`, `Insights_Report.docx` |
| **Tejmul Movin** | Implement preprocessing scripts, feature extraction, and data validation | `preprocessing_scripts.ipynb`, `cleaned_transactions.csv` |
| **M Sree Sai Nath** | Analyze correlation metrics, identify association rules, and assist in visual interpretation | `association_trends.ipynb`, `trend_correlation_report.docx` |

**Expected Outcome:**  
Well-documented data exploration with visual insights that highlight significant behavioral trends and guide modeling strategies.

---

### **Phase 3 – Predictive Modeling, Evaluation, and Presentation (Nov 21 – Dec 3)**

**Objective:**  
Develop predictive models to segment customers, forecast patterns, and evaluate performance through metrics and visual reports.

| Member | Tasks | Deliverables |
| ------- | ------ | ------------ |
| **M Sree Sai Nath (Lead)** | Train and evaluate clustering or association models; generate interpretive summaries | `model_training.ipynb`, `results_summary.docx` |
| **A Jithendranath** | Support model optimization, compare algorithms, and finalize integrated pipeline | `model_comparison.ipynb`, `final_report.pdf` |
| **Tejmul Movin** | Prepare concluding documentation and presentation materials | `findings_and_conclusion.docx`, `presentation_slides.pptx` |

**Expected Outcome:**  
A fully integrated predictive modeling framework supported by evaluated results, insights, and visual presentation materials.

## 4. Project Timeline

| Date Range | Phase | Focus Area | Key Deliverables | Lead |
| ----------- | ------ | ----------- | ---------------- | ---- |
| **Nov 1 – 5** | Phase 1 | Documentation & Planning | Work Division Plan, Research Objectives, Dataset Rationale, Methodology Plan | **Tejmul Movin** |
| **Nov 6 – 20** | Phase 2 | Data Exploration & Visualization | EDA Notebooks, Insights Report, Processed Dataset | **A Jithendranath** |
| **Nov 21 – Dec 3** | Phase 3 | Modeling & Presentation | Trained Models, Evaluation Metrics, Presentation Slides | **M Sree Sai Nath** |

---

## 5. Workflow and Collaboration Protocol

To ensure transparency, collaboration, and version control, the team follows a **GitHub-centered workflow** integrated with **Notion task tracking**.

**Workflow Steps:**
1. Each member works on a dedicated Git branch:  
   - `tejmul/data-cleaning`  
   - `jithendranath/exploration`  
   - `sainath/modeling`  
2. Regular commits are made following the structured format:  
   - `Action – File or Task`  
    Example: `Added EDA Notebook – Visualized purchase frequency by weekday`
3. Members create **Pull Requests (PRs)** for review before merging to the main branch.  
4. All project activities and deadlines are tracked via the **Notion Kanban Board**.
